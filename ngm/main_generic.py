"""
Neural graphical models for the conditional 
independence graphs. The conditional independence
graphs show the partial correlations between the 
nodes (features). 

Functions for NGMs:
1. Learning
2. Inference
3. Sampling

Note that this implementation is for 
1. Undirected graphs.
2. Input data should be real valued.

TODO: Implementation for the directed graphs. 
TODO: Extend to images and categorical variables.
